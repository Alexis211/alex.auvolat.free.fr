Hi.

This is the source code of the website at http://alex.auvolat.free.fr/

To set it up on your own server :

- Copy the files in this repository somewhere on your server
- Copy lib/conf/sql.php.template to lib/conf/sql.php and edit to your needs
- Execute the contents of schema.sql on your mysql database
- Make sure you have an images/ directory and that your server can write in it.
- (Create an admin account in the database)
